# Styling Guidelines

- Use Tailwind CSS whenever possible; refactor existing code to Tailwind when modifying it
- Follow Apple design language principles, with a focus on iOS-like user experience
- Use Lucide icons exclusively
- Make dropdown menus opaque, not transparent
- Implement responsive design with a mobile-first approach

## Styling Boundaries

### Centralized Styles (in styles folder)
- Global theme variables (colors, spacing, typography)
- Layout systems and grid definitions
- Animation keyframes and transitions
- Utility classes used across multiple components
- Global reset and normalization styles

### Component-Specific Styles
- Shadcn UI component customizations
- Complex component-specific animations
- One-off styling needs that don't warrant global utilities
- Styles that are tightly coupled to component logic

## Tailwind vs. SCSS Usage

### Use Tailwind for:
- Component layout and positioning
- Responsive design implementation
- Spacing, sizing, and typography
- Common interactive states (hover, focus)
- Most UI component styling

### Use SCSS for:
- Complex animations and transitions
- Global theme variables that need preprocessing
- Custom component styles that would be verbose in Tailwind
- Legacy code maintenance

### Implementation:
- Start with Tailwind utilities first
- Extract common patterns to Tailwind components
- Use SCSS with `@apply` for complex cases only
- Avoid mixing inline Tailwind and external SCSS for the same component

## Layout and Typography
- Use Flexbox and Grid utilities effectively
- Implement proper spacing system
- Use container queries when appropriate
- Implement proper responsive breakpoints
- Use semantic color naming in design
- Implement proper color contrast for accessibility
- Configure custom fonts properly
- Use proper font size and line height utilities

## Component Styling
- Use shadcn/ui components as the foundation
- Extend components with consistent styling patterns
- Keep component variants consistent
- Implement subtle animations for better UX
- Use proper transition utilities
- Always consider accessibility in styling decisions

## Performance
- Minimize custom CSS
- Follow class order conventions for readability
- Implement responsive typography
- Use proper responsive spacing
- Optimize for production builds


## TypeScript Guardrails

- Guard grouped collections before dereferencing the first element in JSX loops; bail out if the array is empty.
- Keep Supabase writes aligned with column nullability; when schema tightens a field to NOT NULL, update client payloads to supply a safe value instead of `null`.
- When a Supabase table is dropped or renamed, remove all associated queries, payload building, and imports in one sweep before re-running `tsc`.
- After schema edits, audit feature components for stale imports or props that rely on removed data surfaces.
